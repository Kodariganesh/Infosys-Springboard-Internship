May I have your order number, please?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, it's BB987654321.\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me check your order details. Could you please hold for a moment?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay, I'll hold.\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for waiting. I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused. I understand that you are facing difficulty in assembling the refrigerator. Is that correct?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, that's right. I received the parts from different sellers, and I'm not sure how to assemble them.\\n\\nAgent: I see. We do offer clubbing orders from different sellers for combined delivery to save shipping costs. However, I understand that it may cause inconvenience to customers. Let me check if we can arrange for an expert to assist you in assembling the refrigerator. Could you please hold for a moment while I check?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay, I'll hold.\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for waiting. Unfortunately, we don't have an expert available for assembling the refrigerator.

It also has diagrams to help you understand the process. Would you like me to guide you through the process?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, please.\\n\\nAgent: Okay. First, you need to attach the rails to the freezer compartment door. Then, you need to slide the freezer compartment onto the rails. Once it's in place, you need to secure it with screws.
